# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to make changes recommended by the beta testers to the PlanMyTrip app. The following tasks are to be completed: 

1. Adding the weather description to the weather data youâ€™ve already retrieved in this module.
2. Have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences (Min temp = 60, Max temp = 90).
3. Identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
4. From the list of potential travel destinations, have the beta testers choose four cities to create a travel itinerary.
5. Using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Results

- Deliverable 1: 
   -Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data  gathered in this module, use API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

- Deliverable 2: 
   -Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

- Deliverable 3: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map.
   -Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data  gathered in this module, use API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

## Summary

To summarize, data from for the first quarter of 2019. The following observations were made:

1. Total Fares remained relatively flat across all three city types.
2. Total Fares appear to have the highest growth in Suburban cities.
3. Urban ci
